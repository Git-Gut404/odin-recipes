        <h4>Steps to reach candy heaven</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In mixer bowl, put a ⅓ of a cup of cold water.</li>
            <li>Empty the packet of gelatin over water and let it sit</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, combine 1 cup of sugar with a ¼ of a cup of water</li>
            <li>Swirl to combine well</li>
            <li>Using a candy thermometer, heat over medium heat until it reaches soft ball stage (115 C)</li>
            <li>Do not stir during this process. If crystals form on pan walls, use brush with water to dissolve it back down</li>
            <li>When at 115 C, remove from heat and slowly pour into a mixer bowl with gelatin</li>
            <li>Stir by hand for a couple minute to break any gelatin lumps</li>
            <li>When cooled slightly, place on mixer with whisk attachment and combine at medium-high speed until white and somewhat stiff</li>
            <li>Immediately transfer to large piping bag</li>
            <li>With colored sugar in a shallow dish, pipe chick shapes directly into the sugar</li>
            <li>Use a spoon to cover the marshmallow chicks with sugar</li>
            <li><strong>Liftoff!</strong></li>
        </ol>
